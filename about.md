# About page

I'm Arihant, a dedicated data scientist and a passionate educator at heart (which is why I created this website!). The purpose of this platform is to democratize machine learning education, offering readers a centralized hub to initiate their journey into the world of machine learning. I invite you to participate in this noble opportunity through [GitHub](https://github.com/MLBible). Together, let's make a difference in the world, one pull request at a time.
